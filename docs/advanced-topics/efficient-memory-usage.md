Separating metadata (dNib) from data enables more efficient use of memory. Since the dNib carries information about the data type and structure, memory can be precisely allocated according to the requirements of data allocation, leading to minimized waste of memory space. For example, empty or undefined areas can be easily identified and reused or overwritten without the need for extensive garbage collection processes.

By allowing data to be stored either directly or through address references (indirectly), the system can dynamically decide how and where to allocate memory. For small data values that fit directly next to the dNib, memory space can be conserved since no additional references are required. Larger data structures or those that can grow dynamically, such as lists or strings, utilize indirect referencing, allowing memory allocation to be tailored to needs and in variable sizes.

### Type System and Type Verification

The foundation of type safety in mDm is built upon a robust type system that is defined in a declarative manner, using type definitions imported from `types6.mdmD`. These definitions are essential for enforcing type safety throughout the program's execution.

#### Importing Type Definitions

First, we import the type definitions required for our system:

```mDm
import types6.mdmD
```

#### Defining Type Checking and Conversion Functions

With the type definitions in place, we can define functions to perform type checks and conversions. These functions play a crucial role in maintaining type safety by ensuring that data types are correctly handled and processed.

**Type Checking Function**

This function takes two types as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the types match. This check is critical for ensuring type safety during data processing.

```mDm
(type; type), checkType, (bool)
```

Internally, this function would verify if the two types are compatible, with `true` indicating compatibility and `false` indicating a type conflict.

**Type Conversion Function**

The type conversion function accepts a value and a target type, attempting to convert the value into the specified type. The rules for conversion may vary depending on the involved types and might be prohibited in certain cases, indicated by returning a special value or an error.

```mDm
(_, type), convertType, (_)
```

This function attempts to convert the given value to the specified target type. The implementation details would depend on how type conversions are handled in mDm, including error management and handling of illegal conversions.

### Error Handling in mDm

Error handling in mDm is structured to ensure that programs can gracefully manage exceptions and unexpected conditions.

**Example of Error Handling in Operations**

```mDm
(inputData), riskyOperation, result 
(result), if _, (handleError, _)
```

This example illustrates how mDm handles potential errors that might occur during risky operations. The `if _` construct checks if the result is undefined (represented by `_`), and if so, it triggers an error handling sequence.

This chapter has explored the crucial aspects of type safety and error handling within the mDm programming language. By emphasizing explicit definitions over implicit assumptions, mDm aims to reduce complexity and enhance clarity in software development. The structured programming model integrated with modern programming needs allows for a disciplined yet flexible coding approach. These mechanisms ensure that mDm not only supports the technical requirements of programming but also addresses the conceptual clarity needed to manage complex software development challenges effectively.

mDmâ€™s approach to type safety and error handling demonstrates a thoughtful strategy to manage data integrity and program stability, reflecting the language's overarching goals of robustness and predictability in programming.

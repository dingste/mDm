The use of address references enables the creation of complex, linked data structures, such as linked lists, trees, and graphs, without the need to hold the entire structure in a continuous memory block. This makes it easier to allocate memory for new elements since only the memory for the element itself and not for the entire structure needs to be allocated. Additionally, structure elements can be distributed in memory, optimizing memory usage.

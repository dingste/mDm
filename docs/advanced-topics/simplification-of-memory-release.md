The clear marking of data end and type by the dNib facilitates the release of memory. When a data block is no longer needed, the system can examine the dNib to determine how and where the data are stored (directly or indirectly) and release the corresponding memory. This is particularly useful in environments with manual memory management but can also support automated garbage collection methods.

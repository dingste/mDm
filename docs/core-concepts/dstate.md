In mDm, a **dState** refers to each phase within a dSeq, detailing the specific actions that occur during the input, processing, or output stages of the sequence. These states represent the three core steps—input, processing, and output—that together form the fundamental construct for structured program flow in mDm, reflecting the classic Input-Process-Output (IPO) model.

### Description of dStates:

- **Input**: This stage involves the collection, preprocessing, or provisioning of data necessary for executing the subsequent processing logic.
- **Processing**: At this stage, the actual logic or operations are applied to the input data. This could involve computation, data manipulation, or any form of data processing.
- **Output**: The final step involves presenting, storing, or forwarding the processed results. Outputs may include displaying on a screen, writing to a file, or passing data to the next process.

### ASCII Diagrams for Potential Use Cases:

**Simple Data Processing**:

Here, we see a dSeq that consists of a straightforward input, processing, and output sequence. An example could be reading a value, doubling it, and then displaying the result.

```ascii
 [Input] ---> [Processing] ---> [Output]
   (read)       (double)       (display)
```

**Nested Processing**:

In this example, we observe how one dSeq utilizes another dSeq as part of its processing step. This allows for complex, composite workflows.

```ascii
 [Input] ---> [   Processing   ] ---> [Output]
                  /               \
            [Input]         [Output]
             (inner)           (inner)
```

**Conditional Execution**:

By integrating conditional logic within the processing phase, decisions can be made that influence the execution of further dSeqs.

```ascii
 [Input] ---> [Processing] ---> [Output]
                  |     ^
                  v     |
               [Condition]
               /        \
     [dSeq A]            [dSeq B]
```

**Loop Construct**:

Loops can be realized by feeding the output back to the input of a dSeq, enabling repeated processing until a termination criterion is met.

```ascii
                ___________________
               |                   |
               v                   |
 [Input] ---> [Processing] ---> [Output]
                  | (repeat)
                  v
              [Break? ==> Output = '_']
```

These diagrams illustrate how dStates can be used as building blocks within mDm programming to create structured and modularly built software solutions. The flexibility and clarity provided by the dSeq construct allow developers to intuitively model and solve complex problems.
